## How it works

Prioritizes 8-bit binary number and outputs the decimal result in the 7-segment display. If no bits are set (number equals zero) then a decimal point rather than a digit is displayed.

## How to test

Have fun playing with switches and observe 7-segment display.

## External hardware

None
