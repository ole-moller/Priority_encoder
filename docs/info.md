## How it works

Inputs and prioritizes 8-bit binary number and converts and outputs the decimal result in 7-segment format.
If no bits are set (number equals zero) then a decimal point rather than a digit is displayed.

## How to test

Have fun playing with switches and observe 7-segment display.

## External hardware

None
